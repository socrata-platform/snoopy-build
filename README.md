A project for building Snoopy Logger packages using FPM-Cookery.

This project currently builds for Ubuntu 14.04 only.

***Why not use Omnibus?***

Up until
[recently](https://github.com/RoboticCheese/snoopy-omnibus/tree/43bd4428438c2d6171baecc1037fdb22eca2e38e),
this project did. But an Omnibus pipeline is pretty heavyweight, especially
for a simple application with no dependencies. A build can be completed much
faster by bypassing Omnibus', e.g., installing RBEnv and compiling a fresh
Ruby.

Requirements
============

This project is distributed as a Chef cookbook that contains an FPM-Cookery
recipe which can then be built automatically using Test Kitchen.

You must have a sane Ruby 1.9+ environment with Bundler installed. Ensure all
the required gems are installed:

```shell
bundle install
```

Usage
=====
This project comes with a Test Kitchen config that handles all the builds
automatically for the supported platforms. Normally, the CI server will kick
off a Kitchen run, which will build the package, install it, verify the
results, and publish the new package to PackageCloud.io.

Should the need arise, `fpm-cook` commands can still be run manually from
the recipe directory in `files/default/fpm-recipes/snoopy/`.

Recipes
=======

***default***

Ties together all the other recipes.

***_configure***

Configures the helper class for use by the other recipes.

***_build***

Runs a package build with FPM-Cookery.

***_verify***

Installs the artifact generated by the `_build` recipe and runs some acceptance
tests against it with ServerSpec.

***_deploy***

If configured to publish artifacts, uploads the result of the `_build` recipe
to PackageCloud.

Libraries
=========

***helpers_builder***

Helper methods for the individual instances doing the package builds.

***helpers_coordinator***

Helper methods for the one instance overseeing the ones doing the package
builds.

***helpers***

Helper methods that are common to both the builder and coordinator helper
classes.

Attributes
==========
The included attributes file defines attributes for PackageCloud access, the
build version and revision number, and a boolean controlling whether or not
artifacts should be published to PackageCloud when completed.
